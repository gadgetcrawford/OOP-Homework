 # 4 Central Principles
 ## Encapsulation 
        - information hiding 
        
## Abstraction 
        - a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the     users 
## Inheritance 
      - constructors that inherit features from their parent classes
      
## Polymorphism
  - the presentation of one interface for multiple data types
